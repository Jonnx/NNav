# NNav: Off-Canvas Navigation

NNav is a lightweight framework to create a mobile inspired sidebar navigation
that slides in from the left, much like the native Facebook app.

### Getting Started

In order to be able to use Nnav within your website you need to:
 1. Load jQuery and the ./css & ./js files
 2. Integrate the NNav Structure into Your Website

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/nnav.css" type="text/css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="./js/nnav.jquery.js"></script>
